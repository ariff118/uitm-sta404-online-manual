This book is designed to be your comprehensive guide to the world of statistics, tailored specifically to the curriculum of Universiti Teknologi MARA's undergraduate program. Whether you are a business major, social sciences enthusiast, or a student in any discipline, this book will equip you with the essential knowledge and skills to harness the power of statistics.

In the fast-paced and data-driven world we live in, the ability to make informed decisions is paramount. Statistics is the language of data, and its principles are woven into countless aspects of our daily lives. Understanding statistics is not just an academic endeavor; it's a practical tool that can empower you to navigate the complexities of your chosen field.

The book begins with "Introduction to Statistics," setting the stage by exploring the fundamental concepts, the role of statistics in research and decision-making, and the ethical considerations of data analysis. We then delve into "Descriptive Statistics," where we unveil the art of summarizing and presenting data in a meaningful way.

"Estimation" and "Hypothesis Testing" are two pivotal chapters that bridge the gap between data and decision-making. You'll learn how to make educated guesses about population parameters and how to rigorously test hypotheses using real-world examples.

The journey culminates in "Bivariate Analysis," where we explore the relationships between two variables, offering insights into correlation, regression, and their applications in business and social sciences.

Each chapter is designed with clarity in mind, with practical examples and exercises to reinforce your understanding. Additionally, we provide a range of resources, including data sets and online tools, to help you apply your knowledge beyond the textbook.

As you embark on this statistical voyage, remember that learning statistics is not just about mastering formulas and techniques; it's about developing a critical mindset, where you can question, interpret, and draw meaningful conclusions from data. This book is your trusted companion in that journey.

We hope this book becomes an invaluable resource, both in your academic pursuits and in your future professional endeavors. Embrace the world of statistics with confidence, and discover how it can enhance your ability to analyze, interpret, and contribute to the business and social sciences fields.

Statistics may appear daunting at first, but with patience and persistence, it can be a fascinating and empowering discipline. So, let's embark on this enlightening journey together, and may this book be your steadfast guide. Enjoy your exploration of "Statistics for Business and Social Sciences."
