# Estimation

## Learning Objectives: {-}

1. Describe and construct the interval estimation for the mean of the population parameter (both σ known and σ unknown) for **large and small sample size**.
2. Describe and construct the interval estimation for the difference between two means (both σ known and σ unknown) for **independent** sample.
3. Describe and construct the interval estimation for the difference between two means (both σ known and σ unknown) for **dependent** sample.

## Introduction

Estimation is the process in which a numerical value collected from a sample is assigned to a population parameter. The value(s) that is assigned to a population parameter based on the sample statistic is called an estimation while the sample statistic used to estimate population parameter is called an estimator. There are two (2) types of estimates that will be discussed in this chapter name as point estimate and interval estimate.

## Point Estimation

A point estimate is a specific numerical value estimate of a parameter.

The value calculated from a sample mean, $\bar{x}$ is the best point estimate of the population mean, $\mu$.
In estimation, the calculation margin of error is calculated based on point estimation.

## Interval Estimation\

-	An **interval estimate** of a parameter is an **interval** or a **range** of values used to estimate the parameter based on observations from one sample. There are two (2) values in the interval estimate: **lower limit** and **upper limit**.\
-	The interval constructed around the point estimate, but the estimate may or may not contain the value of the parameter being estimated.\
-	Each interval constructed also regards a given confidence level and it is called a confidence interval.\
-	A **confidence interval** is a specific interval estimate of a parameter determined by using data obtained from a sample and by using the specific confidence level of the estimate.\
-	The **confidence level** of an interval estimate of a parameter is the probability that the interval estimate will contain the parameter. It is denoted by (1-)100%. The is called a **significance level** (probability that the parameter is not within the interval).\
-	In constructing a confidence interval, researchers can choose any value for confidence level for example 90%, 95% and 99%.\

A researcher wishes to estimate the number of days it takes an automobile dealer to sell Aza Aveo. A sample of 50 cars had a mean time on the dealer’s lot of 54 days. Assume the population standard deviation to be 6.0 days. Find the best point estimate of the population mean and the 95% confidence interval of the population mean.

The best point estimate of the mean ($\mu$) is 54 days.

Given:

The degrees of freedom (df) are **$n-1$**.\
<span style="color:blue;">Note:</span> Refer to **Table 7** from Statistical Table
:::

-	The value of σ, when it is not known, must be estimated using the standard deviation (s) of the sample.
-	When standard deviation (s) is used, especially when the sample size is small (less than 30), critical values greater than the values for are used in confidence intervals to keep the interval at a given level, such as the 95%.
-	These values are taken from the **Student _t_-distribution,** most often called the **_t_-distribution**.

**Characteristics of the t -distribution**

The t -distribution is like the standard normal distribution in these ways:

-	It is bell-shaped.
-	It is symmetric about the mean.
-	The mean, median, and mode are equal to 0 and are located at the center of the distribution.
-	The curve never touches the x-axis.

The t-distribution differs from the standard normal distribution in the following ways:

-	The variance is greater than 1.
-	The t-distribution is a family of curves based on the concept of  **degrees of freedom** which is related to sample size.
-	As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution.

A random sample of 10 children found that their average growth for the first year was 9.8 inches. Assume the variable is normally distributed and the sample standard deviation is 0.96 inch. Find the 95% confidence interval of the population mean for growth during the first year.

Given that $\bar{X}=9.8, s=0.96, n=10, df=10-1=9$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{X} – t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},df}\left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \lt &\mu \lt \bar{X} + t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},df}\left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\\
9.8 – t_{\frac{0.05}{2},9}\left(\frac{0.96}{\sqrt{10}}\right) \lt &\mu \lt 9.8 + t_{\frac{0.05}{2},9}\left(\frac{0.96}{\sqrt{10}}\right)\\

Assume that the population standard deviation for those in the first and second age group found by previous studies are 6.3 and 5.8 hours respectively.

**CASE 2: Difference Between Two Means of Independent Samples: _Using the t-test_ **\

Assumptions:\

1. The samples are random samples.
2. The sample data are independent of one another.
3. When the sample sizes are less than 30, the populations must be normally or approximately normally distributed.\

The Independent t-test was used to compare the average values and determine the significant difference in the means of the two groups. The Independent t-test **assumes the variance of the two sample groups are approximately equal or the samples have homogeneity of variance**. The variance does not have too precisely equal but just close enough. The homogeneity of variance means the two groups are of the same nature or have the same kind of variability. To know if the variance is close enough to be called homogeneous or not, the **Levene Test for Equality of Variances** will be used.\

Based on the 90% confidence interval, is there sufficient evidence to conclude that the difference in the means is statistically significant?\

**Step 1:** Checking for Equality of Variances using Levene's Test

$H_0:\sigma_1^2=\sigma_2^2$ (equal variances assumed)\
$H_1:\sigma_1^2\ne\sigma_2^2$ (equal variances not assumed)\

Refer to column "Leven's Test for Equality of Variances" we obtained:
*p*-value = 0.189\
Since *p*-value = 0.189 > $\alpha$ = 0.05, we reject $H_1$ and cocluded that equal variances is assumed.

A sample of nine local banks shows their deposits (in billions of ringgit Malaysia) 3 years ago and their deposits (in billions of ringgit Malaysia) today. At α = 0.05, can it be concluded that the average in deposits for the banks is greater today than it was 3 years ago? Determine the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means for the data given.\

A dietitian wishes to see if a person’s cholesterol level will change if the diet is supplemented by a certain mineral. Six patients were pretested, and then they took the mineral supplement for a 6-week period. The results are shown in the table. (Cholesterol level is measured in milligrams per deciliter.) Based on the 90% confidence interval, can it be concluded that the cholesterol level has been changed? Assume the variable is approximately normally distributed.\
