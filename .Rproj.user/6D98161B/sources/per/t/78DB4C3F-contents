    Sample: 300 students from College YY.
    Variable:     i) Number of hours spent
                  ii) Assessment marks
                  
b)  Population: All students from 50 classes of School Y.
    Sample: Students from selected 10 classes.
    Variable: Students' satisfaction

## Type of statistics

Generally, **statistics** is divided into two broad categories, depending on how data are used. The two categories are **Descriptive Statistics** and **Inferential Statistics**. A **Descriptive Statistics** describe a *summary* information about variables in data. While, **Inferential Statistics** uses sample data to make an inference or draw a conclusion about the population. The description of Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics shown in Table 1.1.

![Table 1.1 Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics](images/ch1/Picture5.png){width=500px}

<span style="color:green;">**Example 1.2**</span>

a) The average donation received from Five Top Company was RM50000.
b) In a research study found that anxiety with behavioral intention has a significant
inverse causal effect on the behavior of students using communication technology.

<span style="color:red;">**Answer**</span>

a) Descriptive Statistics
b) Inferential Statistics

## Type of data

The term “Data” refers to a collection of measurements made on one or more observational
units that used to describe situations or events. Statistical data are usually obtained by
counting or measuring items. Depending on the sources, statistical data are classified into
two types; **Primary Data** and **Secondary Data**.

a) *Primary data* is a data that are collected for the first time and are thus original in
nature.

b) *Secondary data* have already been compiled or collected by some other persons and
are available for statistical analysis.

The advantages and disadvantages of primary and secondary data shown in Table 1.2.

![Table 1.2 Advantages and disadvantage of primary and secondary data](images/ch1/Picture6.png){width=500px}

<span style="color:green;">**Example 1.3**</span>

Describe the type of data below.

a) A statistics textbook
b) A mailed questionnaire

<span style="color:red;">**Answer**</span>

a) Secondary Data
b) Primary Data

## Data collection

Data are collected in a variety of ways. For **primary data**, one of the most common method
is through the use of survey. Survey is a research process of collecting a data that can be
done by using a variety of method. The most common methods are telephone surveys,
questionnaire survey and the personal interviews. The descriptions of these methods are
shown in Table 1.3.

![Table 1.3 Descriptions of telephone surveys, questionnaire survey and personal interviews](images/ch1/Picture7.png){width=500px}

**Secondary data** are collected from readily available sources such as websites, article
journals, books, etc. It supplies second-hand data collection from other sources, either from individuals or an organization. Among the top sources of secondary data are:

a) Journal articles that comment on or analyse research
b) Textbooks
c) Dictionaries and encyclopaedias
d) Book and interpret, analyse
e) Political commentary
f) Biographies
g) Dissertations
h) Newspaper editorial/opinion pieces

## Variables and types of variables

Variables can be classified as Quantitative Variable or Qualitative Variable.

### Quantitative Variables

Quantitative data is an observation that are measured on a numerical scale. Basically, the
quantitative data are in the form of values, percentage, frequency, or numbers. This type of
data can be visualized using diagram such as tables, graphs, and histogram.

If the variables in the data are being studied, the variables that are report numerically is called quantitative variable.

Quantitative variables are always in numbers and are the result of counting or measuring
attributes of a population. Quantitative variable can be separated into two subgroups:

> **Discrete** can assume only integer value (if it is the result of counting, examples
the number of students of a given ethnic group in a class, the number of books
on a shelf)

> **Continuous** can assume any value over a continuous range of possibilities (if it
is the result of measuring, examples distance traveled, weight of luggage)

### Qualitative Variables

Qualitative data is opposite with quantitative data. Qualitative data provide varieties of
items in terms of categories base. It is generally described by words or letters. For example, in qualitative data may contains information about gender, age category or pass or fail.However, if the characteristics or variables being studied is in categorical or non-numerical it is called as qualitative variable.

Qualitative variables can be separated into two subgroups:

> **dichotomic** (if it takes the form of a word with two options (gender - male or
female)

> **polynomic** (if it takes the form of a word with more than two options (education
- primary school, secondary school, and university)

Usually, a researcher will represent a qualitative variable with a proportion or percentage,
while a pie chart, pareto chart, or bar chart will use to visualize a qualitative variables.

c) Stress level (Mild, Medium, Severe, Very Severe)
d) Food preference

<span style="color:red;">**Answer**</span>

a) Ratio
b) Interval
c) Ordinal
d) Nominal

## Sampling

Sampling is a process of taking a subset of element from a population. The sample taken
from the sampling process have a same characteristic with its population. However, the
samples selected are not a perfect representative of population depending on where they are
selected. Therefore, there always occur some error in the result of analysis called as
sampling error. A **sampling error** is the difference between the results obtained from a sample and the results obtained from the population.

## Sampling Method

Random vs Non-Random sampling

![](images/ch1/Picture11.png){width=500px}

![](images/ch1/Picture12.png){width=500px}

### Simple Random Sample

- Number each frame unit from 1 to N.
- Use a random number table or a random number generator to select n distinct
numbers between 1 and N, inclusively.
- Easier to perform for small populations.
- Cumbersome for large populations

![Source: Allan G. Bluman (2010)](images/ch1/Picture13.png){width=500px}

### Systematic Sampling

- Convenient and relatively easy to administer.
- Population elements are an ordered sequence (at least, conceptually).
- The first sample element is selected randomly from the first k population elements.
- Thereafter, sample elements are selected at a constant interval, k, from the
ordered sequence frame.

![Source: Allan G. Bluman (2010)](images/ch1/Picture14.png){width=500px}

### Stratified Random Sample

- Population is divided into nonoverlapping subpopulations called strata.
- A random sample is selected from each stratum.
- Potential for reducing sampling error.
- Proportionate -- the percentage of the sample taken from each stratum is
proportionate to the percentage that each stratum is within the population.
- Disproportionate -- proportions of the strata within the sample are different than
the proportions of the strata within the population.

![Source: Allan G. Bluman (2010)](images/ch1/Picture15.png){width=500px}

### Cluster Sampling

- Population is divided into non overlapping clusters or areas
- Each cluster is a miniature, or microcosm, of the population.
- A subset of the clusters is selected randomly for the sample.
- If the number of elements in the subset of clusters is larger than the desired value
of n, these clusters may be subdivided to form a new set of clusters and subjected

![Source: Allan G. Bluman (2010)](images/ch1/Picture16.png){width=500px}

**Advantages**

- More convenient for geographically dispersed populations.
- Reduced travel costs to contact sample elements.
- Simplified administration of the survey.
- Unavailability of sampling frame prohibits using other random sampling
methods.

**Disadvantages**

- Statistically less efficient when the cluster elements are similar.
- Costs and problems of statistical analysis are greater than for simple random
sampling to a random selection process.

### Nonrandom Sampling

1. **Convenience Sampling**: sample elements are selected for the convenience of the
researcher.
2. **Judgement Sampling**: sample elements are selected by the judgment of the
researcher.
3. **Quota Sampling**: sample elements are selected until the quota controls are
satisfied.
4. **Snowball Sampling**: survey subjects are selected based on a referral from other
survey respondents
