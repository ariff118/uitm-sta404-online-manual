Basically, the quantitative data are in the form of values, percentage, frequency, or numbers. This type of data can be visualized using diagram such as tables, graphs, and histogram.\nIf the variables in the data are being studied, the variables that are report numerically is called quantitative variable.\nQuantitative variables are always in numbers and are the result of counting or measuring attributes of a population. Quantitative variable can be separated into two subgroups:\n\nDiscrete can assume only integer value (if it is the result of counting, examples the number of students of a given ethnic group in a class, the number of books on a shelf)\n\n\nContinuous can assume any value over a continuous range of possibilities (if it is the result of measuring, examples distance traveled, weight of luggage)\n\n\n\n1.6.2 Qualitative Variables\nQualitative data is opposite with quantitative data. Qualitative data provide varieties of items in terms of categories base. It is generally described by words or letters. For example, in qualitative data may contains information about gender, age category or pass or fail.However, if the characteristics or variables being studied is in categorical or non-numerical it is called as qualitative variable.\nQualitative variables can be separated into two subgroups:\n\ndichotomic (if it takes the form of a word with two options (gender - male or female)\n\n\npolynomic (if it takes the form of a word with more than two options (education - primary school, secondary school, and university)\n\nUsually, a researcher will represent a qualitative variable with a proportion or percentage, while a pie chart, pareto chart, or bar chart will use to visualize a qualitative variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRemember, in dealing with qualitative variable, calculating the mean or average makes no sense.\n\n\nExample 1.5\nState whether the following quantitative or qualitative variable.\n\nNumber of diabetes patients\nPizza sizes (small, medium, and large)\nCholesterol count\n\nAnswer\n\nQuantitative (Discrete)\nQualitative\nQuantitative (Continuous)"

The symbol \\(\\bar{x}\\) is used for sample mean and is given by the following formula:\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_{n-1} + x_n}{n} = \\frac{\\sum{x}}{n}\n\\] For a population, the Greek letter \\(\\mu\\) (mu) is used for the mean.\n\\[\n\\bar{X} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + ... + X_{n-1} + X_N}{N} = \\frac{\\sum{X}}{N}\n\\]\nExample 2.1\nThe number of calls that a local police department responded to for a sample of 9 months is shown. Find the mean.\n\n475, 447, 440, 761, 993, 1052, 783, 671, 621\n\nAnswer\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum{x}}{n} &= \\frac{475+447+440+761+993+1052+783+671+621}{9} \\\\\n&= \\frac{6243}{9} \\approx 693.7\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nInterpretation: On average, the number of calls responded by local police department is approximately 694 calls.\nExample 2.2\nA climatologist recorded daily temperature in Sungai Petani for twelve days. The data points are as follows (in degrees Celsius):\n\n30.5, 31.2, 29.8, 30.0, 30.7, 31.5, 29.9, 30.3, 30.1, 31.0, 30.4, 31.8\n\nCalculate the mean of daily temperature, and interpretation of the meaning of the mean value.\nAnswer\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{x} &= \\frac{30.5+31.2+29.8+30.0+30.7+31.5+29.9+30.3+30.1+31.0+30.4+31.8}{12} \\\\\n&= 30.75^\\circ C\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] On average, the daily temperatures in Sungai Petani for twelve days is \\(30.75^\\circ C\\).\nExample 2.3\nIn a bakery, the number of doughnuts sold in 7 days is recorded as follows:\n\n53, 60, 45, 77, 58, 42, 68\n\nAnswer\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{x} &= \\frac{53 + 60 + 45 + 77 + 58 + 42 + 68}{7} \\\\\n&= 57.57\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nOn average, the number of doughnuts sold in seven days is approximately 58 doughnuts.\nProperties of the Mean\n\nFound by using all the values of data.\nVaries less than the median or mode.\nUsed in computing other statistics, such as the variance.\nUnique, usually not one of the data values.\nCannot be used with open-ended classes.\nAffected by extremely high or low values, called outliers.\n\nMedian\nThe median is the midpoint of the data array. The symbol for the median is \\(\\tilde{x}\\). How to identify median value?\n\nSort the data in ascending order\nIdentify the location of median using\nDetermine the value of median\n\n\nIf the number of data (n) is ODD, the value is in the middle of sequence\nIf the number of data (n) is EVEN, the value of median is average of 2 middle values\n\nExample 2.4\nThe number of police officers killed in the line of duty over the last 11 years is shown. Find the median.\n\n175 152 121 142 188 154 160 165 148 156 239\n\nAnswer:\n\nSort the data in ascending order\n\n\n121, 142, 148, 152, 154, 156, 160, 165, 175, 188, 239\n\nii Identify the location of median:\n\\[\n\\frac{11 + 1}{2} = 6^{th}\n\\]\n\nSelect the middle value, \\(\\tilde{x} = 156\\)\n\nExample 2.5\nThe number of tornadoes that have occurred in the certain country over an 8-year period follows.\n\n684, 764, 656, 702, 856, 1133, 1132, 1303\n\nFind the median.\nAnswer:\nSince the data given is even-number, there will be two values in the middle.\n\nSort the data in ascending order\n\n\n656, 684, 702, 764, 856, 1132, 1133, 1303\n\nii Identify the location of median:\n\\[\n\\frac{8 + 1}{2} = 4.5^{th}\n\\]\n\nSelect the middle value, \\(\\tilde{x} = \\frac{764 + 856}{2} = \\frac{1620}{2} = 810\\)\n\nInterpretation of median: Half of the tornadoes that have occurred in a certain country is less than or equal to 810 of tornadoes.\nProperties of Median\n\nGive the midpoint.\nUsed when it is necessary to find out whether the data values fall into the upper half or lower half of the distribution.\nCan be used for an open-ended distribution.\nAffected less than the mean by extremely high or extremely low values.\n\nMode\nThe mode is the value that occurs most often in a data set. It is sometimes said to be the most typical case. There may be no mode, one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or many modes (multimodal). Symbol of the mode is \\(\\hat{x}\\).\nExample 2.6\nFind the mode of the signing bonuses of eight football players for a specific year. The bonuses in thousands of ringgit Malaysia (RM) are:\n\n18.0, 14.0, 34.5, 10, 11.3, 10, 12.4, 10\n\nAnswer:\nYou may find it easier to sort first.\n\n10, 10, 10, 11.3, 12.4, 14.0, 18.0, 34.5\n\nSelect the value that occurs the most.\nInterpretation: Most of the players signed the bonuses of 10 thousand ringgits Malaysia.\nExample 2.7\nThe data show the number of licensed nuclear reactors in the certain country for a recent 15-year period. Find the mode.\n\n103 103 103 103 103 106 108 108 108 110 108 112 112 112 108\n\nAnswer:\n103 and 108 both occur the most. The data set is said to be bimodal. The modals are 103 and 108.\nProperties of mode\n\nUsed when the most typical case is desired.\nEasiest average to compute.\nCan be used with nominal data.\nNot always unique or may not exist.\n\nDistributions Shape\n\n\n\nFigure 7: a) Positively skewed or right-skewed\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: b) Symmetrical distribution since mean, mode and median are equal\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: c) Negatively skewed or left-skewed\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Measure of variation\nMeasures of variation include range, standard deviation, variance, and coefficient of variation.\nThe range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a data set.\n\nRange = Highest – Lowest\n\nThe population variance is the average of the squares of the distance each value is from the mean.\nThe standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\nExample 2.8\nThe table below shows the life-long (in months) of two brands of paint.\n\n\n\nBrand XX\nBrand YY\n\n\n\n\n10\n35\n\n\n60\n45\n\n\n50\n30\n\n\n30\n35\n\n\n40\n40\n\n\n20\n25\n\n\n\nDetermine the mean and standard deviation for the above data.\nAnswer:\n Brand XX: \\(\\mu = mean = \\frac{\\sum{x}}{N} = \\frac{210}{6} = 35\\) and \\(Range = 60 - 10 = 50\\). \nBrand YY: \\(\\mu = mean = \\frac{\\sum{x}}{N} = \\frac{210}{6} = 35\\) and \\(Range = 45 -25 = 20\\).\nThe average for both brands is the same, but the range for Brand XX is much greater than the range for Brand YY. Which brand would you buy?\nUses of the Variance and Standard Deviation\n\nTo determine the spread of the data.\nTo determine the consistency of a variable.\nTo determine the number of data values that fall within a specified interval in a distribution (Chebyshev’s Theorem).\nUsed in inferential statistics.\n\nPopulation variance:\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum{(X - \\mu)^2}}{N}\n\\]\nPopulation Standard Deviation\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sum{(X - \\mu)^2}}{N}}\n\\]\nSample variance:\n\\[\ns^2 = \\frac{\\sum{(X - \\bar{X})^2}}{n-1}\\ \\ \\ or\\ \\ \\ s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\left[\\sum{X^2} - \\frac{(\\sum{X})^2}{n}\\right]\n\\]\nSample Standard Deviation:\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{(X - \\bar{X})^2}}{n-1}}\\ \\ \\ or\\ \\ \\ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\left[\\sum{X^2} - \\frac{(\\sum{X})^2}{n}\\right]}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean, expressed as a percentage.\n\\[\nCoefficient\\ of\\ Variation\\ (CV)\\ = \\frac{s}{x} \\times 100\\%\n\\]\nExample 2.9\nThe mean of the number of sales of cars over a 3-month period is 87, and the standard deviation is 5. The mean of the commissions is $5225, and the standard deviation is $773. Compare the variations of the two.\nAnswer:\n\\(CV_{Sales} = \\frac{5}{87} \\times 100\\% = 5.7\\%\\)\n\\(CV_{Commissions} = \\frac{773}{5225} \\times 100\\% = 14.8\\%\\)\nThe data distribution for Commissions are more dispersed than sales. Similarly, Sales data distribution is more consistent than the data distribution in commissions.\nExample 2.10\nA meteorologist is studying the monthly rainfall patterns in two different regions, Region A and Region B, over the past year. They have collected data for 11 months (in mm). The goal is to determine which region has more dispersed rainfall. Calculate the coefficient of variation for each region’s monthly rainfall data and identify which region’s data is more dispersed.\n\n\n\n\nSPSS Output\n\n\n\nAnswer:\n\\(CV_{Region A} = \\frac{\\sqrt{43.634}}{36.5427} \\times 100\\% = 18.08\\%\\)\n\\(CV_{Region B} = \\frac{\\sqrt{9.894}}{60.5745} \\times 100\\% = 5.19\\%\\)\nRegion A has a more dispersed rainfall pattern than Region B.\n\n\n2.3.3 Measure of skewness\nSkewness is the measurement of the lack of symmetry of the distribution. There are several measures for expressing the amount of skewness, but the only important one is the Pearson Coefficient of Skewness:\n\\[\nPCS = \\frac{mean - mode}{standard\\ deviation}\\ \\ \\ \\ or\\ \\ \\ \\ PCS = \\frac{3(mean - median)}{standard\\ deviation}\n\\]\nSkewness\nIt is the degree of distortion from the symmetrical bell curve or the normal distribution. It measures the lack of symmetry in data distribution. It differentiates extreme values in one versus the other tail. A symmetrical distribution will have a skewness of 0.\nThere are two types of Skewness: Positive and Negative.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Types of Skewness\n\n\nExample 2.11\nThe SPSS output gives information on descriptive statistics on the number of licensed nuclear reactors in the certain country for a recent 15-year period. Find the Person Coefficient of Skewness. Hence identify the shape of distribution.\nAnswer:\n\n\n\n\nSPSS Output\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nPCS &= \\frac{3(\\bar{x} - \\tilde{x})}{s} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3(107.6 - 108)}{5.193} \\\\\n&= -0.2311\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNegatively skewed.\nExample 2.12\nThe table below shows the number of eggs laid by 20 chickens over a 30-day period in a small poultry farm. Calculate the Pearson Coefficient of Skewness. Hence identify the shape of distribution.\nAnswer:\n\n\n\n\nSPSS Output\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nPCS &= \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\hat{x}}{s} \\\\\n&= \\frac{38.55 - 42}{6.809} \\\\\n&= -0.5067\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNegatively skewed.\n\n\n2.3.4 Measures of Position (Q, Q2, and Q3)\nQuartiles separate the data set into 4 equal groups. \\(Q_1 = P_{25}\\), \\(Q_2 = MD\\), \\(Q_3 = P_{75}\\)\nThe Interquartile Range, \\(IQR = Q_3 – Q_1\\).\nExample 2.13\nFind \\(Q_1\\), \\(Q_2\\), and \\(Q_3\\) for the data set.\n\n15, 13, 6, 5, 12, 50, 22, 18\n\nAnswer:\nSort in ascending order.\n\n5, 6, 12, 13, 15, 18, 22, 50\n\nLocation: \\(Q_1 = \\frac{n + 1}{4}\\) → \\(Q_1 = \\frac{8 + 1}{4} = 2.25^{th}\\) in the array.\nValue of Q1: \\(X_{Q_1} = 6 + 0.25 (12 - 6) = 7.5\\)\nLocation: \\(Q_2 = \\frac{n + 1}{2}\\) → \\(Q_2 = \\frac{8 + 1}{2} = 4.5^{th}\\) in the array.\nValue of Q2: \\(X_{Q_2} = 13 + 0.5 (15 - 13) = 14\\)\nLocation: \\(Q_3 = 3(\\frac{n + 1}{4})\\) → \\(Q_3 = 3(\\frac{8 + 1}{4}) = 6.75^{th}\\) in the array.\nValue of Q3: \\(X_{Q_3} = 18 + 0.75 (22 - 18) = 21\\)\nAn outlier is an extremely high or low data value when compared with the rest of the data values. A data value less than Q1 – 1.5(IQR) or greater than Q3 + 1.5(IQR) can be considered an outlier.\n\n\n2.3.5 Box-and-whisker plot\nAlso known as box plots, they display a five-number summary of a set of data. Consist of - (i) minimum, (ii) first quartile, (iii) median, (iv) third quartile, and (v) maximum values.\nAble to identify the centre, the spread, and the skewness of the data\nExample 2.14\nThe number of meteorites found in 10 U.S. states is shown. Construct a boxplot for the data. Hence, determine its skewness.\n\n89, 47, 164, 296, 30, 215, 138, 78, 48, 39 30, 39, 47, 48, 78, 89, 138, 164, 215, 296\n\nFive-Number Summary: 30; 47; 83.5; 164; 296\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Skewed to the right / right skewness / positively skewed\n\n\n\nExample 2.15\nA meteorologist is studying the monthly rainfall patterns in two different regions, Region A and Region B, over the past year. They have collected data for 11 months (in mm). They determine the skewness of the two regions based on box and whiskers plot.\nAnswer :\n\n\n\n\nSPSS Output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Region A – positively skewed; Region B – Approximately normal"

There are two (2) values in the interval estimate: lower limit and upper limit.\n\nThe interval constructed around the point estimate, but the estimate may or may not contain the value of the parameter being estimated.\n\nEach interval constructed also regards a given confidence level and it is called a confidence interval.\n\nA confidence interval is a specific interval estimate of a parameter determined by using data obtained from a sample and by using the specific confidence level of the estimate.\n\nThe confidence level of an interval estimate of a parameter is the probability that the interval estimate will contain the parameter. It is denoted by (1-)100%.
