From 1000 students, the dean decides to select only 300 students as a respondent. The information about the number of hours spent and assessment marks are collected.\n\nb) A headmaster of School Y conducted a study on students' satisfaction (strongly disagree=1, disagree=2, neutral=3, agree=4, strongly agree=5) with online distance learning conducted by their teachers. The headmaster selects only 10 out of 50 classes in School Y. The study included all students in these classes.\n\n<span style=\"color:red;\">**Answer**</span>\n\na)  Population: All 1000 students from College YY.\n    Sample: 300 students from College YY.\n    Variable:     i) Number of hours spent\n                  ii) Assessment marks\n                  \nb)  Population: All students from 50 classes of School Y.\n    Sample: Students from selected 10 classes.\n    Variable: Students' satisfaction\n\n## Type of statistics\n\nGenerally, **statistics** is divided into two broad categories, depending on how data are used. The two categories are **Descriptive Statistics** and **Inferential Statistics**. A **Descriptive Statistics** describe a *summary* information about variables in data. While, **Inferential Statistics** uses sample data to make an inference or draw a conclusion about the population. The description of Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics shown in Table 1.1.\n\n![Table 1.1 Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics](images/ch1/Picture5.png){width=500px}\n\n<span style=\"color:green;\">**Example 1.2**</span>\n\na) The average donation received from Five Top Company was RM50000.\nb) In a research study found that anxiety with behavioral intention has a significant\ninverse causal effect on the behavior of students using communication technology.\n\n<span style=\"color:red;\">**Answer**</span>\n\na) Descriptive Statistics\nb) Inferential Statistics\n\n## Type of data\n\nThe term “Data” refers to a collection of measurements made on one or more observational\nunits that used to describe situations or events. Statistical data are usually obtained by\ncounting or measuring items. Depending on the sources, statistical data are classified into\ntwo types; **Primary Data** and **Secondary Data**.\n\na) *Primary data* is a data that are collected for the first time and are thus original in\nnature.\n\nb) *Secondary data* have already been compiled or collected by some other persons and\nare available for statistical analysis.\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of primary and secondary data shown in Table 1.2.\n\n![Table 1.2 Advantages and disadvantage of primary and secondary data](images/ch1/Picture6.png){width=500px}\n\n<span style=\"color:green;\">**Example 1.3**</span>\n\nDescribe the type of data below.\n\na) A statistics textbook\nb) A mailed questionnaire\n\n<span style=\"color:red;\">**Answer**</span>\n\na) Secondary Data\nb) Primary Data\n\n## Data collection\n\nData are collected in a variety of ways. For **primary data**, one of the most common method\nis through the use of survey. Survey is a research process of collecting a data that can be\ndone by using a variety of method. The most common methods are telephone surveys,\nquestionnaire survey and the personal interviews. The descriptions of these methods are\nshown in Table 1.3.\n\n![Table 1.3 Descriptions of telephone surveys, questionnaire survey and personal interviews](images/ch1/Picture7.png){width=500px}\n\n**Secondary data** are collected from readily available sources such as websites, article\njournals, books, etc. It supplies second-hand data collection from other sources, either from individuals or an organization. Among the top sources of secondary data are:\n\na) Journal articles that comment on or analyse research\nb) Textbooks\nc) Dictionaries and encyclopaedias\nd) Book and interpret, analyse\ne) Political commentary\nf) Biographies\ng) Dissertations\nh) Newspaper editorial/opinion pieces\n\n## Variables and types of variables\n\nVariables can be classified as Quantitative Variable or Qualitative Variable.\n\n### Quantitative Variables\n\nQuantitative data is an observation that are measured on a numerical scale. Basically, the\nquantitative data are in the form of values, percentage, frequency, or numbers. This type of\ndata can be visualized using diagram such as tables, graphs, and histogram.\n\nIf the variables in the data are being studied, the variables that are report numerically is called quantitative variable.\n\nQuantitative variables are always in numbers and are the result of counting or measuring\nattributes of a population. Quantitative variable can be separated into two subgroups:\n\n> **Discrete** can assume only integer value (if it is the result of counting, examples\nthe number of students of a given ethnic group in a class, the number of books\non a shelf)\n\n> **Continuous** can assume any value over a continuous range of possibilities (if it\nis the result of measuring, examples distance traveled, weight of luggage)\n\n### Qualitative Variables\n\nQualitative data is opposite with quantitative data. Qualitative data provide varieties of\nitems in terms of categories base. It is generally described by words or letters. For example, in qualitative data may contains information about gender, age category or pass or fail.However, if the characteristics or variables being studied is in categorical or non-numerical it is called as qualitative variable.\n\nQualitative variables can be separated into two subgroups:\n\n> **dichotomic** (if it takes the form of a word with two options (gender - male or\nfemale)\n\n> **polynomic** (if it takes the form of a word with more than two options (education\n- primary school, secondary school, and university)\n\nUsually, a researcher will represent a qualitative variable with a proportion or percentage,\nwhile a pie chart, pareto chart, or bar chart will use to visualize a qualitative variables.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n<span style=\"color:red;\">Remember, in dealing with qualitative variable, calculating the mean or average makes no sense.</span>\n:::\n\n<span style=\"color:green;\">**Example 1.5**</span>\n\nState whether the following quantitative or qualitative variable.\n\na) Number of diabetes patients\nb) Pizza sizes (small, medium, and large)\nc) Cholesterol count\n\n<span style=\"color:red;\">**Answer**</span>\n\na) Quantitative (Discrete)\nb) Qualitative\nc) Quantitative (Continuous)\n\n## Level of measurement\n\n![](images/ch1/Picture8.png){width=500px}\n\n<span style=\"color:green;\">**Example 1.6**</span>\n\nState the level of measurement for each variable below:\n\na) The number of students in KAM2283A\nb) Temperature in Malaysia\nc) Stress level (Mild, Medium, Severe, Very Severe)\nd) Food preference\n\n<span style=\"color:red;\">**Answer**</span>\n\na) Ratio\nb) Interval\nc) Ordinal\nd) Nominal\n\n## Sampling\n\nSampling is a process of taking a subset of element from a population. The sample taken\nfrom the sampling process have a same characteristic with its population. However, the\nsamples selected are not a perfect representative of population depending on where they are\nselected. Therefore, there always occur some error in the result of analysis called as\nsampling error. A **sampling error** is the difference between the results obtained from a sample and the results obtained from the population.\n\n![](images/ch1/Picture9.png){width=500px}\n\n![](images/ch1/Picture10.png){width=500px}\n\n## Sampling Method\n\nRandom vs Non-Random sampling\n\n![](images/ch1/Picture11.png){width=500px}\n\n![](images/ch1/Picture12.png){width=500px}\n\n### Simple Random Sample\n\n- Number each frame unit from 1 to N.\n- Use a random number table or a random number generator to select n distinct\nnumbers between 1 and N, inclusively.\n- Easier to perform for small populations.\n- Cumbersome for large populations\n\n![Source: Allan G. Bluman (2010)](images/ch1/Picture13.png){width=500px}\n\n### Systematic Sampling\n\n- Convenient and relatively easy to administer.\n- Population elements are an ordered sequence (at least, conceptually).\n- The first sample element is selected randomly from the first k population elements.\n- Thereafter, sample elements are selected at a constant interval, k, from the\nordered sequence frame.\n\n![Source: Allan G. Bluman (2010)](images/ch1/Picture14.png){width=500px}\n\n### Stratified Random Sample\n\n- Population is divided into nonoverlapping subpopulations called strata.\n- A random sample is selected from each stratum.\n- Potential for reducing sampling error.\n- Proportionate -- the percentage of the sample taken from each stratum is\nproportionate to the percentage that each stratum is within the population.\n- Disproportionate -- proportions of the strata within the sample are different than\nthe proportions of the strata within the population.\n\n![Source: Allan G. Bluman (2010)](images/ch1/Picture15.png){width=500px}\n\n### Cluster Sampling\n\n- Population is divided into non overlapping clusters or areas\n- Each cluster is a miniature, or microcosm, of the population.\n- A subset of the clusters is selected randomly for the sample.\n- If the number of elements in the subset of clusters is larger than the desired value\nof n, these clusters may be subdivided to form a new set of clusters and subjected\n\n![Source: Allan G. Bluman (2010)](images/ch1/Picture16.png){width=500px}\n\n**Advantages**\n\n- More convenient for geographically dispersed populations.\n- Reduced travel costs to contact sample elements.\n- Simplified administration of the survey.\n- Unavailability of sampling frame prohibits using other random sampling\nmethods.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n- Statistically less efficient when the cluster elements are similar.\n- Costs and problems of statistical analysis are greater than for simple random\nsampling to a random selection process.\n\n### Nonrandom Sampling\n\n1. **Convenience Sampling**: sample elements are selected for the convenience of the\nresearcher.\n2. **Judgement Sampling**: sample elements are selected by the judgment of the\nresearcher.\n3. **Quota Sampling**: sample elements are selected until the quota controls are\nsatisfied.\n4. **Snowball Sampling**: survey subjects are selected based on a referral from other\nsurvey respondents\n\n## Exercise 1\n\n1. A private company manager is interested in studying the relationship between time spent\non social media and employee performance. He believed that the more time spent on\nsocial media, the more likely the performance drops. The performance of the employee\nis categorized as excellent, moderate, and low.
