Identify various ways to present collected data from survey of secondary sources\n2. Use appropriate data presentation for a qualitative and quantitative data\n3. Calculate the measures of central tendency, measure of variation, measure of skewness and measure of position for ungrouped data.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhen conducting a statistical study, the researcher must gather data for the variable under study. For example, if a researcher wishes to study the number of road accidents in Malaysia for the past 2 years, he or she must gather the data from various departments. To describe the situation, draw conclusions, or make inferences about the event, the researcher must organize the data and present it in some meaningful way.\n\n<center> ![](images/ch2/picture1.png){width=600px} </center>\n\nThe data can be presented in term of graphical approach or table and numerical descriptive measure for both qualitative dan quantitative data.\n\n## Organizing Data\n\n**Charts and graphs**\n\n- Frequency distributions are good ways to present the essential aspects of data collections in concise and understandable terms\n- Pictures are always more effective in displaying large data collections\n\n**Histogram**\n\n- Frequently used to graphically present interval and ratio data\n- The adjacent bars indicate that a numerical range is being summarized by indicating the frequencies in arbitrarily chosen classes\n\n![Figure 1: Histogram – distribution of the ages (in months) of 50 children](images/ch2/picture2.png){width=500px}\n\n**Frequency Polygon**\n\n- Another common method for graphically presenting interval and ratio data\n- To construct a frequency polygon mark the frequencies on the vertical axis and the values of the variable being measured on the horizontal axis, as with the histogram.\n- If the purpose of presenting is to compare with other distributions, the frequency polygon provides a good summary of the data\n\n![Figure 2: Frequency Polygon – distribution of the ages (in months) of 50 children](images/ch2/picture3.png){width=500px}\n\n**Ogive**\n\n- A graph of a cumulative frequency distribution\n- Ogive is used when one wants to determine how many observations lie above or below a certain value in a distribution.\n- First cumulative frequency distribution is constructed\n- Cumulative frequencies are plotted at the upper-class limit of each category\n- Ogive can also be constructed for a relative frequency distribution.\n\n![Figure 3: Ogive distribution of the ages (in months) of 50 children](images/ch2/picture4.png){width=500px}\n\n**Pie Chart**\n\n- The pie chart is an effective way of displaying the percentage breakdown of data by category.\n- The size of angle (°) is determined based on the frequency of group/category\n- Useful if the relative sizes of the data components are to be emphasized\nPie charts also provide an effective way of presenting ratio- or interval-scaled data after they have been organized into categories\n- How to compute angle/degree?\n$$\nx^{\\circ} = \\frac{f}{\\sum{x}} \\times 360\n$$\n![Figure 4: Pie – Condition of gym facilities](images/ch2/picture5.png){width=500px}\n\n**Bar Charts**\n\n- Another common method for graphically presenting nominal and ordinal scaled data\n- One bar is used to represent the frequency for each category\n- The bars are usually positioned vertically with their bases located on the horizontal axis of the graph\n- The bars are separated, and this is why such a graph is frequently used for nominal and ordinal data – the separation emphasize the plotting of frequencies for distinct categories\n\n![Figure 5: Bar Chart – Condition of gym facilities](images/ch2/picture6.png){width=500px}\n\n**Stem and Leaf**\n\nA *stem and leaf plot* is a data plot that uses part of a data value as the stem and part of the data value as the leaf to form groups or classes.\n\n![](images/ch2/picture7.png){width=500px}\n\n![Figure 6: Stem-and-Leaf Diagram](images/ch2/picture8.png){width=500px}\n\n## Numerical descriptive measures (ungrouped)\n\n- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)\n- Measure of variation (range, standard deviation, variance, coefficient of variation\n- Measure of skewness\n- Measures of Position (Q1, Q2, and Q3)\n\n<center> ![](images/ch2/picture9.png){width=600px} </center>\n\n### Measures of Central Tendency\n\n**Mean**\n\nThe mean is the quotient of the sum of the values and the total number of values. The symbol $\\bar{x}$ is used for **sample mean** and is given by the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_{n-1} + x_n}{n} = \\frac{\\sum{x}}{n}\n$$\nFor a population, the Greek letter $\\mu$ (mu) is used for the mean.\n\n$$\n\\bar{X} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + ... + X_{n-1} + X_N}{N} = \\frac{\\sum{X}}{N}\n$$\n\n<span style=\"color:green;\">**Example 2.1**</span>\n\nThe number of calls that a local police department responded to for a sample of 9 months is shown.

The symbol for the median is $\\tilde{x}$.\nHow to identify median value?\n\ni. Sort the data in ascending order\nii. Identify the location of median using \niii. Determine the value of median\n\n  - If the number of data (n) is ODD, the value is in the middle of sequence\n  - If the number of data (n) is EVEN, the value of median is average of 2 middle values\n    \n<span style=\"color:green;\">**Example 2.4**</span>\n\nThe number of police officers killed in the line of duty over the last 11 years is shown.

It is sometimes said to be the most typical case. There may be no mode, one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or many modes (multimodal). Symbol of the mode is $\\hat{x}$.\n\n<span style=\"color:green;\">**Example 2.6**</span>\n\nFind the mode of the signing bonuses of eight football players for a specific year.  The bonuses in thousands of ringgit Malaysia (RM) are:\n\n<center> 18.0, 14.0, 34.5, 10, 11.3, 10, 12.4, 10 </center>\n\n<span style=\"color:red;\">**Answer:**</span>\n\nYou may find it easier to sort first.\n\n<center> **10, 10, 10,** 11.3, 12.4, 14.0, 18.0, 34.5 </center>\n\nSelect the value that occurs the most.\n\n**Interpretation:** Most of the players signed the bonuses of 10 thousand ringgits Malaysia.\n\n<span style=\"color:green;\">**Example 2.7**</span>\n\nThe data show the number of licensed nuclear reactors in the certain country for a recent 15-year period.

There are several measures for expressing the amount of skewness, but the only important one is the Pearson Coefficient of Skewness:\n\n$$\nPCS = \\frac{mean - mode}{standard\\ deviation}\\ \\ \\ \\ or\\ \\ \\ \\ PCS = \\frac{3(mean - median)}{standard\\ deviation}\n$$\n\n**Skewness**\n\nIt is the *degree of distortion* from the symmetrical bell curve or the normal distribution. It measures the lack of symmetry in data distribution. It differentiates extreme values in one versus the other tail. A symmetrical distribution will have a skewness of 0.\n\nThere are two types of Skewness: **Positive** and **Negative**.\n\n![Figure 8: Types of Skewness](images/ch2/picture14.png){width=500px}\n\n<span style=\"color:green;\">**Example 2.11**</span>\n\nThe SPSS output gives information on descriptive statistics on the number of licensed nuclear reactors in the certain country for a recent 15-year period.
