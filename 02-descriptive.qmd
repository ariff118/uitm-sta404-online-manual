# Descriptive Statistics

## Learning objectives: {-}

1. Identify various ways to present collected data from survey of secondary sources
2. Use appropriate data presentation for a qualitative and quantitative data
3. Calculate the measures of central tendency, measure of variation, measure of skewness and measure of position for ungrouped data.

## Introduction

When conducting a statistical study, the researcher must gather data for the variable under study. For example, if a researcher wishes to study the number of road accidents in Malaysia for the past 2 years, he or she must gather the data from various departments. To describe the situation, draw conclusions, or make inferences about the event, the researcher must organize the data and present it in some meaningful way.

The data can be presented in term of graphical approach or table and numerical descriptive measure for both qualitative dan quantitative data.

## Organizing Data

**Charts and graphs**

- Frequency distributions are good ways to present the essential aspects of data collections in concise and understandable terms
- Pictures are always more effective in displaying large data collections

**Histogram**

- Frequently used to graphically present interval and ratio data
- The adjacent bars indicate that a numerical range is being summarized by indicating the frequencies in arbitrarily chosen classes

![Figure 1: Histogram – distribution of the ages (in months) of 50 children](images/ch2/picture2.png){width=500px}

**Frequency Polygon**

- Another common method for graphically presenting interval and ratio data
- To construct a frequency polygon mark the frequencies on the vertical axis and the values of the variable being measured on the horizontal axis, as with the histogram.
- If the purpose of presenting is to compare with other distributions, the frequency polygon provides a good summary of the data

![Figure 2: Frequency Polygon – distribution of the ages (in months) of 50 children](images/ch2/picture3.png){width=500px}

**Ogive**

- A graph of a cumulative frequency distribution
- Ogive is used when one wants to determine how many observations lie above or below a certain value in a distribution.
- First cumulative frequency distribution is constructed
- Cumulative frequencies are plotted at the upper-class limit of each category
- Ogive can also be constructed for a relative frequency distribution.

![Figure 3: Ogive distribution of the ages (in months) of 50 children](images/ch2/picture4.png){width=500px}

**Pie Chart**

- The pie chart is an effective way of displaying the percentage breakdown of data by category.
- The size of angle (°) is determined based on the frequency of group/category
- Useful if the relative sizes of the data components are to be emphasized
Pie charts also provide an effective way of presenting ratio- or interval-scaled data after they have been organized into categories
- How to compute angle/degree?
$$
x^{\circ} = \frac{f}{\sum{x}} \times 360
$$
![Figure 4: Pie – Condition of gym facilities](images/ch2/picture5.png){width=500px}

**Bar Charts**

- Another common method for graphically presenting nominal and ordinal scaled data
- One bar is used to represent the frequency for each category
- The bars are usually positioned vertically with their bases located on the horizontal axis of the graph
- The bars are separated, and this is why such a graph is frequently used for nominal and ordinal data – the separation emphasize the plotting of frequencies for distinct categories

![Figure 5: Bar Chart – Condition of gym facilities](images/ch2/picture6.png){width=500px}

**Stem and Leaf**

A *stem and leaf plot* is a data plot that uses part of a data value as the stem and part of the data value as the leaf to form groups or classes.

![](images/ch2/picture7.png){width=500px}

![Figure 6: Stem-and-Leaf Diagram](images/ch2/picture8.png){width=500px}

## Numerical descriptive measures (ungrouped)

- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measure of variation (range, standard deviation, variance, coefficient of variation
- Measure of skewness
- Measures of Position (Q1, Q2, and Q3)

<center> ![](images/ch2/picture9.png){width=600px} </center>

### Measures of Central Tendency

**Mean**

The mean is the quotient of the sum of the values and the total number of values. The symbol $\bar{x}$ is used for **sample mean** and is given by the following formula:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_{n-1} + x_n}{n} = \frac{\sum{x}}{n}
$$
For a population, the Greek letter $\mu$ (mu) is used for the mean.

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + ... + X_{n-1} + X_N}{N} = \frac{\sum{X}}{N}
$$

<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.1**</span>

The number of calls that a local police department responded to for a sample of 9 months is shown. Find the mean.

<center> 475, 447, 440, 761, 993, 1052, 783, 671, 621 </center>

<span style="color:red;">**Answer**</span>


$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum{x}}{n} &= \frac{475+447+440+761+993+1052+783+671+621}{9} \\
&= \frac{6243}{9} \approx 693.7
\end{aligned}
$$

**Interpretation:** On average, the number of calls responded by local police department is approximately 694 calls.

<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.2**</span>

A climatologist recorded daily temperature in Sungai Petani for twelve days. The data points are as follows (in degrees Celsius):

<center> 30.5, 31.2, 29.8, 30.0, 30.7, 31.5, 29.9, 30.3, 30.1, 31.0, 30.4, 31.8 </center>

Calculate the mean of daily temperature, and interpretation of the meaning of the mean value.

<span style="color:red;">**Answer**</span>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{x} &= \frac{30.5+31.2+29.8+30.0+30.7+31.5+29.9+30.3+30.1+31.0+30.4+31.8}{12} \\
&= 30.75^\circ C
\end{aligned}
$$
On average, the daily temperatures in Sungai Petani for twelve days is $30.75^\circ C$.

<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.3**</span>

In a bakery, the number of doughnuts sold in 7 days is recorded as follows:

<center> 53, 60, 45, 77, 58, 42, 68 </center>

<span style="color:red;">**Answer**</span>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{x} &= \frac{53 + 60 + 45 + 77 + 58 + 42 + 68}{7} \\
&= 57.57
\end{aligned}
$$

On average, the number of doughnuts sold in seven days is approximately 58 doughnuts.

**Properties of the Mean**

- Found by using all the values of data.
- Varies less than the median or mode.
- Used in computing other statistics, such as the variance.
- Unique, usually not one of the data values.
- Cannot be used with open-ended classes.
- Affected by extremely high or low values, called outliers.

**Median**

The **median** is the midpoint of the data array.  The symbol for the median is $\tilde{x}$.
How to identify median value?

i. Sort the data in ascending order
ii. Identify the location of median using 
iii. Determine the value of median

  - If the number of data (n) is ODD, the value is in the middle of sequence
  - If the number of data (n) is EVEN, the value of median is average of 2 middle values
    
<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.4**</span>

The number of police officers killed in the line of duty over the last 11 years is shown. Find the median.

<center> 175 152 121 142 188 154 160 165 148 156 239 </center>

<span style="color:red;">**Answer:**</span>

i. Sort the data in ascending order

<center> 121, 142, 148, 152, 154, 156, 160, 165, 175, 188, 239 </center>

ii Identify the location of median:

$$
\frac{11 + 1}{2} = 6^{th}
$$

iii. Select the middle value, $\tilde{x} = 156$

<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.5**</span>

The number of tornadoes that have occurred in the certain country over an 8-year period follows.

<center> 684, 764, 656, 702, 856, 1133, 1132, 1303 </center>

Find the median.

<span style="color:red;">**Answer:**</span>

Since the data given is even-number, there will be two values in the middle.

i. Sort the data in ascending order

<center> 656, 684, 702, 764, 856, 1132, 1133, 1303 </center>

ii Identify the location of median:

$$
\frac{8 + 1}{2} = 4.5^{th}
$$

iii. Select the middle value, $\tilde{x} = \frac{764 + 856}{2} = \frac{1620}{2} = 810$

**Interpretation of median:** Half of the tornadoes that have occurred in a certain country is less than or equal to 810 of tornadoes.

**Properties of Median**

- Give the midpoint.
- Used when it is necessary to find out whether the data values fall into the upper half or lower half of the distribution.
- Can be used for an open-ended distribution.
- Affected less than the mean by extremely high or extremely low values.

**Mode**

The **mode** is the value that occurs most often in a data set. It is sometimes said to be the most typical case. There may be no mode, one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or many modes (multimodal). Symbol of the mode is $\hat{x}$.

<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.6**</span>

Find the mode of the signing bonuses of eight football players for a specific year.  The bonuses in thousands of ringgit Malaysia (RM) are:

<center> 18.0, 14.0, 34.5, 10, 11.3, 10, 12.4, 10 </center>

<span style="color:red;">**Answer:**</span>

You may find it easier to sort first.

<center> **10, 10, 10,** 11.3, 12.4, 14.0, 18.0, 34.5 </center>

Select the value that occurs the most.

**Interpretation:** Most of the players signed the bonuses of 10 thousand ringgits Malaysia.

<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.7**</span>

The data show the number of licensed nuclear reactors in the certain country for a recent 15-year period. Find the mode.

<center> 103 103 103 103 103 106 108 108 108 110 108 112 112 112 108 </center>

<span style="color:red;">**Answer:**</span>

103 and 108 both occur the most. The data set is said to be bimodal. The modals are 103 and 108.

**Properties of mode**

- Used when the most typical case is desired.
- Easiest average to compute.
- Can be used with nominal data.
- Not always unique or may not exist.

**Distributions Shape**

![Figure 7: a) Positively skewed or right-skewed](images/ch2/picture10.png){width=500px}

![Figure 7: b) Symmetrical distribution since mean, mode and median are equal](images/ch2/picture11.png){width=500px}

![Figure 7: c) Negatively skewed or left-skewed](images/ch2/picture12.png){width=500px}

### Measure of variation

Measures of variation include range, standard deviation, variance, and coefficient of variation.

The **range** is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a data set.
<center> Range = Highest – Lowest </center>

The **population variance** is the average of the squares of the distance each value is from the mean.

The **standard deviation** is the square root of the variance.

<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.8**</span>

The table below shows the life-long (in months) of two brands of paint.

| Brand XX | Brand YY |
|:--------:|:--------:|
| 10       | 35       |
| 60       | 45       |
| 50       | 30       |
| 30       | 35       |
| 40       | 40       |
| 20       | 25       |

Determine the mean and standard deviation for the above data.

<span style="color:red;">**Answer:**</span>

<span style="color:blue;">
Brand XX: $\mu = mean = \frac{\sum{x}}{N} = \frac{210}{6} = 35$ and $Range = 60 - 10 = 50$.
</span>

Brand YY: $\mu = mean = \frac{\sum{x}}{N} = \frac{210}{6} = 35$ and $Range = 45 -25 = 20$.

The average for both brands is the same, but the range for Brand XX is much greater than the range for Brand YY. Which brand would you buy?

**Uses of the Variance and Standard Deviation**

- To determine the spread of the data.
- To determine the consistency of a variable.
- To determine the number of data values that fall within a specified interval in a distribution (Chebyshev’s Theorem).
- Used in inferential statistics.

Population variance:

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum{(X - \mu)^2}}{N}
$$

Population Standard Deviation

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum{(X - \mu)^2}}{N}}
$$


Sample variance:

$$
s^2 = \frac{\sum{(X - \bar{X})^2}}{n-1}\ \ \ or\ \ \ s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\left[\sum{X^2} - \frac{(\sum{X})^2}{n}\right]
$$

Sample Standard Deviation:

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(X - \bar{X})^2}}{n-1}}\ \ \ or\ \ \ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\left[\sum{X^2} - \frac{(\sum{X})^2}{n}\right]}
$$

The **coefficient of variation** is the standard deviation divided by the mean, expressed as a percentage.

$$
Coefficient\ of\ Variation\ (CV)\ = \frac{s}{x} \times 100\%
$$

<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.9**</span>

The mean of the number of sales of cars over a 3-month period is 87, and the   standard deviation is 5. The mean of the commissions is $5225, and the standard deviation is $773. Compare the variations of the two.

<span style="color:red;">**Answer:**</span>

<span style="color:blue;">$CV_{Sales} = \frac{5}{87} \times 100\% = 5.7\%$</span>

$CV_{Commissions} = \frac{773}{5225} \times 100\% = 14.8\%$

The data distribution for Commissions are more dispersed  than sales. Similarly, Sales data distribution  is more consistent than the data distribution in commissions.

<span style=”color:green;”>**Example 2.10**</span>

A meteorologist is studying the monthly rainfall patterns in two different regions, Region A and Region B, over the past year. They have collected data for 11 months (in mm). The goal is to determine which region has more dispersed rainfall. Calculate the coefficient of variation for each region's monthly rainfall data and identify which region's data is more dispersed. 

<center>![SPSS Output](images/ch2/picture13.png){width=400}</center>

<span style="color:red;">**Answer:**</span>

<span style="color:blue;">$CV_{Region A} = \frac{\sqrt{43.634}}{36.5427} \times 100\% = 18.08\%$</span>

$CV_{Region B} = \frac{\sqrt{9.894}}{60.5745} \times 100\% = 5.19\%$

Region A has a more dispersed rainfall pattern than Region B.

### Measure of skewness

Skewness is the measurement of the lack of symmetry of the distribution. There are several measures for expressing the amount of skewness, but the only important one is the Pearson Coefficient of Skewness:

$$
PCS = \frac{mean - mode}{standard\ deviation}\ \ \ \ or\ \ \ \ PCS = \frac{3(mean - median)}{standard\ deviation}
$$

**Skewness**

It is the *degree of distortion* from the symmetrical bell curve or the normal distribution. It measures the lack of symmetry in data distribution. It differentiates extreme values in one versus the other tail. A symmetrical distribution will have a skewness of 0.

There are two types of Skewness: **Positive** and **Negative**.

![Figure 8: Types of Skewness](images/ch2/picture14.png){width=500px}

<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.11**</span>

The SPSS output gives information on descriptive statistics on the number of licensed nuclear reactors in the certain country for a recent 15-year period. Find the Person Coefficient of Skewness. Hence identify the shape of distribution.

<span style="color:red;">**Answer:**</span>

<center> ![SPSS Output](images/ch2/picture15.png){width=400} </center>

$$
\begin{aligned}
PCS &= \frac{3(\bar{x} - \tilde{x})}{s} \\
&= \frac{3(107.6 - 108)}{5.193} \\
&= -0.2311
\end{aligned}
$$

Negatively skewed.

<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.12**</span>

The table below shows the number of eggs laid by 20 chickens over a 30-day period in a small poultry farm. Calculate the Pearson Coefficient of Skewness. Hence identify the shape of distribution.

<span style="color:red;">**Answer:**</span>

<center> ![SPSS Output](images/ch2/picture16.png){width=400} </center>

$$
\begin{aligned}
PCS &= \frac{\bar{x} - \hat{x}}{s} \\
&= \frac{38.55 - 42}{6.809} \\
&= -0.5067
\end{aligned}
$$

Negatively skewed.

### Measures of Position (Q, Q2, and Q3)

**Quartiles** separate the data set into 4 equal groups.  $Q_1 = P_{25}$, $Q_2 = MD$, $Q_3 = P_{75}$

The **Interquartile Range**, $IQR = Q_3 – Q_1$.

<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.13**</span>

Find $Q_1$, $Q_2$, and $Q_3$ for the data set.

<center> 15, 13, 6, 5, 12, 50, 22, 18 </center>

<span style="color:red;">**Answer:**</span>

Sort in ascending order.

<center> 5, 6, 12, 13, 15, 18, 22, 50 </center>

Location: $Q_1 = \frac{n + 1}{4}$ &rarr; $Q_1 = \frac{8 + 1}{4} = 2.25^{th}$ in the array.

Value of Q1: $X_{Q_1} = 6 + 0.25 (12 - 6) = 7.5$

Location: $Q_2 = \frac{n + 1}{2}$ &rarr; $Q_2 = \frac{8 + 1}{2} = 4.5^{th}$ in the array.

Value of Q2: $X_{Q_2} = 13 + 0.5 (15 - 13) = 14$

Location: $Q_3 = 3(\frac{n + 1}{4})$ &rarr; $Q_3 = 3(\frac{8 + 1}{4}) = 6.75^{th}$ in the array.

Value of Q3: $X_{Q_3} = 18 + 0.75 (22 - 18) = 21$

An **outlier** is an extremely high or low data value when compared with the rest of the data values. A data value less than Q1 – 1.5(IQR) or greater than Q3 + 1.5(IQR) can be considered an outlier.

### Box-and-whisker plot

Also known as box plots, they display a **five-number summary** of a set of data. 
Consist of - (i) minimum, (ii) first quartile, (iii) median, (iv) third quartile, and (v) maximum values. 

Able to identify the centre, the spread, and the skewness of the data

<span style="color:green;">**Example 2.14**</span>

The number of meteorites found in 10 U.S. states is shown.  Construct a boxplot for the data. Hence, determine its skewness.
